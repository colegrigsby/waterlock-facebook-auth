## Changes incorporated to better suit asahi 
- added two new config options 
    - doubleReqRedirect 
        - fixes browser pre-fetch token duplication error 
            - just redirects to the url 
    - newUserRedirect  
        - special redirection with a new user that has not registered with fb yet 
        - this allows a form to be autofilled for signup purposes
- User attributes in lieu of auth attributes 
    - origninally, facebook auth placed all the attributes pull from the user's fb profile in the auth model
        - I modified it to only store email and facebookId in auth, and any other attributes in the user model 
            - this will be helpful moving forward for more attributes and demographics to be added to the user
